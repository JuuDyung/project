          <h3><strong>1. Korean BBQ</strong></h3>      
	</div>
        <p>
          The reason why I like Korean meat, which is different from steak or
          barbecue meat eaten abroad, is because of the style of eating meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the meat on the fire board on the table and then enjoy after roasting it.

          <h3><strong>2. Fried Chicken and Beer</strong></h3>
        </div>	  
        <p>
          We can have fried chicken in all around the world, but Korea has various kinds of fried chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, seasoned spicy chicken, soy sauce chicken and so on. Korean people usually have fried chicken with beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's really good taste and I want to recommend to have them.

          <h3><strong>3. Tteok-bokki</strong></h3>     
        </div>	
        <p>
          I like tteok-bokki very much. It is stir-fried rice cake and called 'tteok-bokki'.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a rice cake with red hot pepper paste. The rice cake is a finger size white chewy food made with white rice.
          The red hot pepper paste is made with flour and red hot pepper or Jalepino pepper.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is spicy, but we can choose the level of spicy before we order it.
          You can add  fish cake, boiled egg or even ramyun in it.

          <h3><strong>4. Bibimbap</strong></h3>
	</div>
        <p>
          Bibimbap is the most famous Korean food and is a world-famous health food.
          Bibimbap is kind of mixed rice. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The ingredient of it is a bowl of warm white rice topped with 
          namul which is seasoned vegetables and gochujang
        </p>
        <p>
          which means chili pepper paste. Additionally, the fried egg or sliced beef is on the very top of Bibimbap.  
          We can have it by mixing it all the ingredients together.

          <h3><strong>5. Samgyetang</strong></h3>     
	</div>
        <p>
          Samgyetang is the representative invigorating food of Korea. Most of Korean people have it in summer,
        </p>
        <p>
          especially on the hottest day. Samgyetang is a food that is eaten by boiling ingredients 
          such as ginseng and jujube together with chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is good for rejuvenating your health. It's a great menu for foreigners to eat without burden.
